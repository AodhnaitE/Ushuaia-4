## 📝 Project Overview
In addition to being a medium for entertainment, music is an incredible and powerful language that allows us to express our emotions and feelings. In some cases, music can prove to be efficient on a therapeutic level, especially in particular moments of our life. As emotions and moods can easily be reflected in music, we all try to use music in every moment of our daily life based on our current state of mind, whether we are looking for a stimulant or comfort to calm us down, to sleep, or for sport. The combination of all these aspects is, in fact, the reason why we decided to find a classification model able to help us determine the type of mood of a song.
