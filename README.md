## üìù Project Overview
Besides being a medium for entertainment, music is an incredible and powerful language that allows us to express our emotions and feelings. In some cases, music can prove to be efficient on a therapeutic level, especially in particular moments of our life. As emotions and moods can easily be reflected in music, we all try to use it in every moment of our daily life based on our current state of mind, whether we are looking for a stimulant or comfort to calm us down, to sleep, or for sport. The combination of all these aspects is, in fact, the reason why we decided to find a classification model able to help us determine the type of mood of a song. 

## ETL process
### In the transfromation.ipynb file
1. After downloading our two files from Kaggle, we imported them into jupyter notebook and created data frames using pandas.
Subsequently, we performed a cleaning procedure involving identifying data errors and removing columns not used in our analysis; we also eliminated any empty cells. This phase aims to improve the quality of the data and to have more accurate, consistent and reliable information for the continuation of the project.

2. After transforming the data, using SQL Alchemy, we built a connection between Jupyter notebook and PostgreSQL, where we had previously created a database and two tables to hold our data.
The choice of Postgres was because our two tables have a comune column for which a relational database was ideal.

## Data analysis
### In the Analysis.ipynb file

In this part of our project, we selected nine features from our dataset to conduct our analysis on Spotify music and displayed a statistic summary to summarise and provide a gist of information about our dataset. 
We then displayed the correlations between each selected feature which led us to plot our data's heatmap.
